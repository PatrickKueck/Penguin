# Penguin
PENGUIN is a command-line driven program written in PERL and works on WindowsPCs, Macs and
Linux operating systems. Therefore, It can easily be integrated into automated pipelines of phylogenetic
studies. Furthermore, results issued by PENGUIN can be used to find clusters of genes and/or taxa
with similar split properties. All calculations of the PENGUIN software program are very fast and can be
easily executed on a normal desktop computer, even if data sets consist of phylogenomic data.
To execute PENGUIN, a PERL interpreter as well as P4, a Python package for Maximum Likelihood and
Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences, must be installed on the current run system.
Linux and Mac systems normally have a PERL interpreter pre-installed. However, Windows users have
to install a PERL interpreter ex post. I would recommend the ActivePerl interpreter.
